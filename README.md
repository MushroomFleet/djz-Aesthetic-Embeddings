(for local installations with Automatic1111's webUI)
while inside your installation path
git clone https://github.com/MushroomFleet/djz-Aesthetic-Embeddings extensions/aesthetic-gradients/aesthetic_embeddings

(for google colab, you can use this when installing your automatic1111 webUI )
!$fgitclone https://github.com/MushroomFleet/djz-Aesthetic-Embeddings extensions/aesthetic-gradients/aesthetic_embeddings

All of these were trained on my own Art derived from my own Trained Models, based on my own Art.
Kinda like the snake eating it's own tail. Enjoy !

if you were wondering where to put them, you can copy them into the Extensions folder with the rest of your gradient embeddings
PATH = stable-diffusion-webui\extensions\aesthetic-gradients\aesthetic_embeddings
