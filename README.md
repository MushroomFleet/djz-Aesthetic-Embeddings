welcome welcome !

You can find my Aesthetic Gradient Embedding files here. 
it's kind of you to mention where you get these ;) thx !

improved versions may be made available later

All of these were trained on my own Art derived from my own Trained Models, based on my own Art.
Kinda like the snake eating it's own tail. Enjoy !

if you were wondering where to put them, you can copy them into the Extensions folder with the rest of your gradient embeddings
PATH = stable-diffusion-webui\extensions\aesthetic-gradients\aesthetic_embeddings
